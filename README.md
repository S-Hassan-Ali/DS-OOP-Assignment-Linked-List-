					             "READ ME"
		                THIS IS THE READ ME FILE TO THE CODE UPLOADED WITH IT.


---------------------------BEFORE THE MAIN FUNCTION--------------------------

1. In the begining code header file 'calc.h' is called that contains a class named 'calc' that initializes 
   complex numbers and contain the functions for there addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, 
   each with there "OPERATOR OVERLOADING" functions.
2. Another header file named 'Linkedlist.h' is called that contains a structure named 'dat' that has two 
   doubles named 'r' (to store real value) and 'i' (to store the imaginary value).
3. It also includes a structure named 'node' that contains a variable 'val' of type 'dat' and a pointer of
   the class 'node'. This structure will be used to create nodes in the linked list.
4. It also includes a class 'list', that is used to make and manage the linked list.
5. 'list' contain methods (or functions) that can create members of the linked list; in the start, at a 
   random specified place or in the end, can delete members; in the start, at a random specified place or
   in the end and can also display the whole list.

-----------------------------IN THE MAIN FUNCTION-----------------------------

1. By using the class 'calc' three complex numbers 'A', 'B' and 'C' have been initialized.
2. Four more complex numbers have also been intialized i.e:
	
	a. 'res' (which contains the addition of 'A' and 'B')
	
	b. 'res2' (which contains the subtraction of 'A' and 'C')
	
	c. 'res3' (which contains the multiplication of 'B' and 'C')
	
	d. 'res4' (which contains the division of 'A' and 'C')
	
3. Object named 'Complex' of the class 'list' is made.
4. Three members of the class (or linked list) i.e 'A', 'B' and 'C. have been created using its methods.
5. 'res' is inserted as a member of the list at the last.
6. 'res2' is inserted as a member of the list in the last.
7. 'res3' is inserted as a member of the list in the last.
8. 'res4' is inserted as a member of the list in the last.
9. Fourth member of the list has been deleted.
10. The last member of the list has been deleted.
	
	*** Note: The linked list has been displayed as the output after every step. ***
